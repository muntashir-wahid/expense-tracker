# Expense Tracker

You can see your expenses by year (2019 - 2022), you can filter, and as you filter the user interface automatically updated.It updated with a nice animation and it will show you the expenses for selected year.

And of course you can aslo add a new expense and that will update the charts and the data is also there if switch to another year.

### Project motivation 

It's my first react.js project. I built this project with [React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)  course and I have learned the basics of React.js through this project.
